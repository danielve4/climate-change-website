          <h2>What is climate change?</h2>
          <p>
            Climate is the average or typical weather in a region. 
            Countries near the equator have a climate that is warm 
            while countries near the North or South Pole have a climate 
            that is cooler. Climate change is the change in Earthâ€™s 
            overall climate due to an increase in temperature. The 
            planet is warming and it is being caused by human related 
            activities.

            <h2>The Impact on You</h2>
            <p>
              Climate change affects every person in the world and will 
              affect our children and their children to follow. People 
              in America are noticing longer summers with higher temperatures 
              and shorter winters. Others are experiencing heavier rainfalls 
              that are causing floods more often than before. 
            </p>  
          
            <h3>Causes of Climate Change</h3>
            <p>
              Signs of climate change are becoming more abundant in the 
              atmosphere and in the oceans. There are increasing concentrations of 
              carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to the burning of 
              coal, oil, and gas. The rise in carbon dioxide in the 
              atmosphere is preventing the heat from the sun from leaving 
              Earth, thus affecting the temperatures all over the world. 
            </p>
            <h3>Excessive Heat</h3>
            <p>
              Due to the excess heat that the carbon dioxide is preventing from
              being released, more regions are facing droughts. Not only are they
              facing droughts, but they are also facing an elevated risk of wildfires.
              Besides being dangerous, wildfires pollute the environment with their 
              smoke which also accelerates climate change.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, the excessive can also increase the amount of 
              heat-related illnessess such as heat stokes, heat cramps, heat rashes,
              and heat exhaustion.
            </p>
            <h3>Agriculture Sector Affected</h3>
            <p>
              The United States alone has an agricultural industry producing 
              an estimated $330 billion worth of agricultural commodities. The agricultural 
              systems used in the industry rely heavily on climate to keep production going. 
              This means that negative impacts on the climate is endangering the agricultural 
              industry in the United States. In addition to affecting our economy, we are 
              in danger of producing less food for the ever-growing population.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Ocean Life Threatened</h3>
            <p>
              Not only is the carbon dioxide preventing heat from escaping 
              but it is also interacting with ocean water and making it more 
              acidic (figure 1). This in turn makes the water more 
              corrosive and prevents life forms with shells or skeletons 
              from growing and reproducing normally. The danger these life 
              forms face will affect the marine food chain.

          <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
          <h3>Inform Others</h3>
          <p>
            You can start by spreading the word about climate change. 
            Not enough people are aware that human activity is the 
            cause of our planet warming. A Pew Study conducted in 2014 
            concluded that about half of the elderly surveyed disagree 
            that scientist think the Earth is getting warmer due to 
            human activities (figure 2).

          <h3>Other Transportation Methods</h3>
          <p>
            Another action you can take is using other methods of 
            transportation. Instead of navigating around with a car, 
            you can ride a bike or ride the local public transportation 
            system. Not only does this decrease the amount of traffic in 
            the road but also reduced the amount of pollution coming 
            from vehicles that is strengthening climate change.

          <h2>Getting Involved</h2>
          <p>
            One of the most important steps towards reducing climate change is voting. 
            Unfortunately, not every politician believes in climate change so it is 
            important to know which representatives believe in climate change and have 
            promised to do something about it. Be sure that when you're spreading the word about
            climate change to also talk about voting for candidates that will
            do something about it. You can visit the following links to find more
            information about Illinois representatives and on how to register to vote.
